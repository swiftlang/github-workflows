name: Create automerge PR

# Merges `head_branch` into `base_branch` and opens a PR to incorporate that merge commit into `base_branch`.
#
# The typical use case for this is in the first period after Swift has cut release branches.
# Some repositories want to include most changes from `main` also in the release branch. When this job is set up, it can automatically create PRs to merge `main` into the release branch.
# Maintainers of the package can then inspect the changes to ensure that they are not too risky for the release branch.
# We will also run the normal PR testing on these changes, ensuring that these modifications don't break the build.
#
# Example usage in a repository:
#
# ```
# name: Create PR to merge main into release branch
#
# # In the first period after branching the release branch, we typically want to include all changes from `main` also in the release branch. This workflow automatically creates a PR every Monday to merge main into the release branch.
# # Later in the release cycle we should stop this practice to avoid landing risky changes by disabling this workflow. To do so, disable the workflow as described in https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow

# PRs created by GitHub Actions don't kick off further actions (https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/d57e551ebc1a16dee0b8c9ea6d24dba7627a6e35/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs).
# As a workaround, we mark automerge PRs that are created by GitHub actions as draft and trigger the GitHub actions by marking the PR as ready for review. `ready_for_review` must be added to the PR types for this purpose, eg.
# ```
# on:
#  pull_request:
#    types: [..., ready_for_review]
# ```
# Unfortunately this will also re-trigger testing evenon a normal user's PR (which may have already been tested), but skipping them causes the checks to reset so this is the best we can do for now.
